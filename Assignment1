# Following are the list of an advantages of Git
1) Maintain a complete log history for every single changes in source code including deletion of file, renaming, or every single modification on source code. It's an easy to work on local repository for every developers for their own task and maintain complete history of every changes.
2) second advantage is branching and merging. for examlple, if 16 people are working on same project with different task, they can create an individual branch and maintain changes in code to single branch and then if it's tested successfully then merge it back together. the 
3) Tracebility means track the modification of every single changes in source code.
4) early bug fixes
5) Deliver faster as code is alraedy tested.

# Languages used in Github

# code to create a new branch in git
git branch branch_name

# Define conflict in github
when developers make changes in same line or same file on different branches in git repository.

# Solution to resolve a conflice in github
first pull the most recent version for security purpose
open terminal and navigate it to the local git repository or open local git repository by sign in to the git hub account. open local repository.

# function of git config

# Git fork 
fork means copy of a repository.

# Difference between fork, branch and clone?
Fork means copy of project including repository and still remains the project in git hub that doesn't affect by making changes in copy of repo. Clone means repo copy on my local machine with the help of git. branch is a version of repository that have multiple commits.

# What's the difference between a "pull request" and a "branch"?
branch is a seperate version of code where we can changes in code and make multiple commits and push your code to remote repo and make a pull request. pull request is giving an opportunity to senior people to review, test and evaluaete code before merge it to master.

# git fetch & git pull
git fetch only retrives or download new metadata or recent changes from a remote repo. git fetch doesn't integrate new metadata with working files.
git pull update master branch with the latest changes from the remote server and integrate with working files.

# How to revert previous commit in Git?
we can use git revert/git checkout/git clean/git rm/git reset to revert previous commit on git. for example, git revert master_branch

#Explain the advantages of Forking Workflow
Forking means copy of a repository. the main advantages of this workflow is contributions of every developer can be integrated without giving access to officialrepository. every developer have copy of repo and they can commit and push their code to their personal local repo.

# Difference between HEAD, working tree and index, in Git?
head is a parent branch in local repo, working tree consist files where we are working currently and can view and edit files. Index is a staging area where we put untracked files or put files which we want to commit in a git repo.

# How to identify if a certain branch has been merged into master?
git branch --merged master or 
git branch --merged

# What is the use of a Git clone?
git clone is used to target existing repo and clone or copy it to at new directory.

# What is Git stash?
git stash is a stacks where we can save unfinished codes or messy codes.  it saves working directory and index state.

# When should I use "git stash"?
when working on one branches where you stuck or found messy code and want to switch to another branch at that time git stash is useful.

# What is Git stash drop?
git stash drop is used to remove or delete specific stash which we don't need further and want to delete it.

# Git stash save
The git stash command takes your uncommitted changes and saves them for later use, and then reverts them from your working copy.

# What README.MD ? What is its purpose? What does MD stands for?
MD stands for markdown. README.MD file contains information about other files which exist in the repo. the purpose of this file is to give hint about what the code does and how it compiles.

# How to create repository from command prompt?
open terminal, make a new directory then go to that directory by changing path.
git init (to initialize)
git remote add origin https://github.com/Monali16/Assignments/edit/master/as1
git push -u origin master

# What is the function of ‘git checkout’ in Git?
git checkout is used to navigates between branches and also used to create a branch.

# How can you bring a new feature in the main branch?
by creating a new branch using git checkout
git checkout -b new_feature

# What is the function of ‘git rm’?
git rm is used to remove files from the staging area as well as from working tree.

#  What is the function of ‘git stash apply’?
git stash apply is used to apply changes on stash files which we save previously. 
if we have more than one stash file saved, then we can specify the name  "git stash apply stash_filename" if we don't specify the name, git will consider most recent ones.

# What is the use of ‘git log’?
it list all the commits which we made in repo in reverse order means most recent one shows the first.

# What is ‘git add’ is used for?
git add is used to add the changes in working directory to staging area. changes are not recorede until we do commit.

# What is 'git diff' is used for?
 it's used to track the different between changes made on a file.
 
# What is ‘git status’ is used for?
git status display the status of working directory and staging area.

#  Can we create multiple branch with one command?
no

# what is the command that is used to delete a branch?
git branch -D new_branch

# What is another option for merging in git?
git rebase is another way to mergeing in git. it result into straight line.

# How to remove a file from git without removing it from your file system?
git rm --cached filename.extension

# Use of "git rebase" instead of "git merge"?
it's used to clean messy project history before merge it to master.

# What is a repository in Git?
repository is a folder where we can store all the files related to our project.

# Command used to write a commit message?
git commit -m 'first assignment answers'

# Commit object
A commit object contains the reference to another tree object and some other information(authorname, commit message etc.)

# Write one use-case of Github?

# Name some alternative of Git?
Bitbucket

Gitlab
Gitflow
Mercurial

# What is a gist in Git?
An easy method to share piece of data with others. these piece of informations are hosted by git hub as a repo.

# What is a gist programming?
